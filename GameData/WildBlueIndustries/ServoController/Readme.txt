KAL-1000 Enhancements
- Servo Snapshots: You can move robotics parts and record their state via the snapshot buttons. In the editor you can take snapshots of the animation track's start and end points, and in the editor or in flight you can take a custom snapshot as well. These snapshots can be played back; perfect for doing things like stowing robot arms after deploying and moving them around.

- Servo Manager: Instead of controlling servos via the Part Action Window, now you have a centralized GUI window from which to control the servos.
NOTE: To take advantage of these enhancements, be sure to add servos to the KAL-1000's control group.
